                I had this idea in mind for a while, but it took me some time to acually do it. My child likes when there is some light in the room. I was thinking about building something which not only will provide light, but will be pretty and fun to watch. The other
                requirement was to make it automatically switch on when the lights go off. In theory this supposed to take some pressure of that moment. This part was only my wishful thinking...

                For some time I was thinking about adding a network player to my audio setup. I use a turntable for most of the time, but for some use cases it was no good.
