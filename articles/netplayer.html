        <p>I use a turntable for most of the time, but sometimes using it is just a hassle. Getting up every 20 minutes to play music while working is no fun. Another need expressed by Gosia is internet radio. I researched external DACs for RaspberryPi,
            but there was (is?) issue with IO on rPi. I was even considering buying Mac Mini, but the price is way too high also for the used devices. Then I found <a href="http://www.hifiberry.com/" target="_blank">Hifiberry</a> - a DAC capable of playing
            192kHz/24bit which connects directly to the I2S slot in RaspberryPi. Exactly what I was looking for. Non expensive, high quality DIY device.</p>

        <h3 id="plays-from-a-playlist">Plays from a playlist</h3>
        <p>After some research on Linux distribution I have chosen <a href="http://volumio.org/" target="_blank">Volumio</a> as it uses <a href="http://www.musicpd.org/" target="_blank">MPD</a> and is advertising as a weapon for audiophiles. Volumio is also
            working with Hifiberry with almost out of the box. It was a pleasent surprise to find it runing <code class="language-javascript">shairport</code>, a server to stream from Apple devices.</p>
        <h3 id="plays-internet-radio">Plays Internet Radio</h3>
        <p>We often listen to "Tr√≥jka", known Polish public radio station. Unfortunately it uses some strange codec which makes it unplayable under MPD. I've decided to use <a href="http://mplayerhq.hu" target="_blank">Mplayer</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="plays-music-test-files">Plays music test files</h3>
        <p>What's the fun of owning a DIY network player if one can't take it and test how it sound on your friend's system? I have some space on SD where I copied few files. No need to connect to the (possibly unsafe) local network.</p>

            <img src="../img/netplayer/buttons.png" alt="buttons">
        </p>
        <p>Device has four buttons. <code class="language-javascript">stop</code> / <code class="language-javascript">radio</code> / <code class="language-javascript">music</code> / <code class="language-javascript">test</code>
        </p>
        <p>If this works for you as well feel free to download the software from <a href="https://github.com/zalun/NetPlayer">https://github.com/zalun/NetPlayer</a>.</p>
        <blockquote>I've made a choice to not switch off the device on a usual basis, I can always run <i>ssh</i> and <i>halt</i> it from the terminal. This however might change in the future, I'm considering adding a button on the back panel.</blockquote>

        <h3 id="stop">Stop</h3>
        <p>Stops all music playing clients and restarts <code class="language-javascript">shairport</code>. Stops everything even if it wasn't run by pressing a button.</p>
        <h3 id="radio">Radio</h3>
        <p>Stations are defined in <code class="language-javascript">settings.py</code>. Depending on the current state pressing the button is either playing latest played station or switching to the next one on the list.</p>
        <h3 id="music">Music</h3>
        <p>Plays current song or switches to the next one in playlist. Note that this assumes that a playlist has been created using an MPD client on a different device.</p>
        <h3 id="test">Test</h3>
        <p>Files are read from the directory specified in <code class="language-javascript">settings.py</code>. Again - Plays current song or switches to the next one.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Hearing that the standard impulse power source isn't so good for sound I bought a good quality DIY, but preassembled power source. I've placed it in a separate box as I might want to use it to power another device. The NetPlayer has power input
            and RCA output. It connects to the network using WiFi USB dongle. All music files are copied to the Synology NAS. Boxes used aren't pretty yet, also the buttons are temporary. In the future I will design the front panel with wooded buttons.
            There is also an idea to add display (LED or OLED).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../img/netplayer/prototype-board-1.png" alt="Prototype board">
        </p>
        <p>First I've build a prototype using a prototype board. After it worked well for a week or so, I've ordered the boxes (I bought the cheapest from <a href="http://modushop.pl/" target="_blank">Modushop</a> for about &pound;10 each).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../img/netplayer/open-4-back.png" alt="RCA">
        </p>
        <p>It does look well on the shelf even with the current design.</p>
